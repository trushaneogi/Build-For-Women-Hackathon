### How to setup



### Problems faced
1. Since we are a team of beginners, implementing backend was tricky as we had to implement maps in our website.
2. Google Maps API was paid hence issues were faced in this aspect.
3. We used leafletjs for the maps, the only issue faced here was the geolocation in the laptop which failed to work, hence we had to accept latitudes and longitudes from the user instead of the name of their location.
